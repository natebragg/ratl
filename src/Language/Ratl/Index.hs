-- All combinations of elements of the inputs ordered by total weight, as
-- determined by in index of the input element.  Starting with the empty
-- list, it incrementally increases the weight of previous solutions to the
-- desired weight by prepending input elements whose weight equals the
-- difference.  Previous solutions are remembered in an accumulator in
-- reverse order by overall weight.  This yields all solutions while only
-- increasing the size of each solution by one each iteration, as larger
-- solutions have already been created during the previous itration.
